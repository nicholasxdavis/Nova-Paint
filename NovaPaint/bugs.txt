#BUGS
	//Eraser cursor isnt showing on erase.

	// Eraser needed to be clicked again to be unToggled. Problem: Right now, When you're using the eraser and want to switch to another tool or color, you have to turn off the eraser first. We want to change it so that if you click on a different tool or color, the eraser automatically turns off by itself. This will make it easier to switch between tools without accidentally erasing things when you don't mean to.

	// Erase doesnt recognize Layers and doesnt work with it, Problem: Right now, erasing deletes everything on all layers. We need to make it so that erasing only removes things from the layer you're working on. This way, you won't accidentally erase parts of your drawing you didn't mean to.

	// Users cant see what layer is selected (No visual change is taking place). 

	// Color Picker button wont open up Browsers integrated Color Picker.
